Stock Portfolio Optimization and Analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation
Overview
This script performs stock portfolio analysis using historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library. It computes various financial metrics, including expected returns, covariance matrix, portfolio variance, Sharpe ratio, and downside volatility. 
, it runs a Monte Carlo simulation to generate multiple portfolios, optimizes the portfolio based on the Sharpe ratio, and visualizes the results using the efficient frontier.
